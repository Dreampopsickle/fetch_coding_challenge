# Fetch Rewards Coding Challenge

This repository contains the solution for the Fetch Rewards Coding Challenge. It includes a data model, SQL queries to answer business questions, and a comprehensive suite of data quality checksâ€”all executed in BigQuery. Additionally, a Python ingestion script is provided to load raw JSON data into BigQuery.

This project leverages Docker to create a consistent development environment.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are set in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

- `DBT_PROFILES_DIR`: `/app/fetch_coding_challenge`  
  (Specifies where the DBT profiles are located.) --- \*\*\*Note: dbt was not used for this project but is established for future use
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: `/app/credentials/service_account.json`  
  (Points to the service account file for accessing Google Cloud services.)
- `BIGQUERY_DATASET`: `fetch_data`  
  (Designates the BigQuery dataset used in this project.)

_Note:_ For security best practices, the `service_account.json` file is included in your `.gitignore` to ensure sensitive credentials are not exposed in this public repository. Make sure to add your own service account file in the `credentials` directory when setting up your local environment.
